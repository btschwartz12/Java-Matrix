# Java-Matrix

## Ben Schwartz

This is a simple Java implementation of a 2-D matrix, consisting of the following file:

- `Matrix.java`: provides methods for creating, initializing, and manipulating a 2-D matrix

The `Matrix` class includes methods for creating a new matrix with a specified number of rows and columns, initializing the matrix with default values, setting and getting individual elements in the matrix, and printing the matrix to the console.

Please note that this is a high school project, and may not be as functional or optimized as other 2-D matrix libraries. It is intended as a learning exercise and is not intended for production use.
